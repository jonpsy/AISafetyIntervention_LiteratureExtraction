Policies are *plans* for achieving good outcomes in environments where:\n\n- The agent makes a *sequence* of *distinct* choices, rather than choosing once.\n\n- The environment is *stochastic* (or \"random\").\n\n- Some features of the environment are initially *unknown* to the agent. (So the agent may choose to gain information in order to improve future decisions.)\n\nThis section begins with agents that solve the very simplest decision problems. These are trivial *one-shot* problems, where the agent selects a single action (not a sequence of actions). We use WebPPL to solve these problems in order to illustrate the core concepts that are necessary for the more complex problems in later chapters.\n\n<a id=\"planning_as\"></a>\n\n## One-shot decisions in a deterministic world\n\nIn a *one-shot decision problem* an agent makes a single choice between a set of *actions*, each of which has potentially distinct *consequences*. A rational agent chooses the action that is best in terms of his or her own preferences. Often, this depends not on the *action* itself being preferred, but only on its *consequences*. \n\nFor example, suppose Tom is choosing between restaurants and all he cares about is eating pizza. There's an Italian restaurant and a French restaurant. Tom would choose the French restaurant if it offered pizza. Since it does *not* offer pizza, Tom will choose the Italian.\n\nTom selects an action $$a \\in A$$ from the set of all actions. The actions in this case are {\"eat at Italian restaurant\", \"eat at French restaurant\"}. The consequences of an action are represented by a transition function $$T \\colon S \\times A \\to S$$ from state-action pairs to states. In our example, the relevant *state* is whether or not Tom eats pizza. Tom's preferences are represented by a real-valued utility function $$U \\colon S \\to \\mathbb{R}$$, which indicates the relative goodness of each state. \n\nTom's *decision rule* is to take action $$a$$ that maximizes utility, i.e., the action\n\n$$\n{\\arg \\max}_{a \\in A} U(T(s,a))\n$$\n\nIn WebPPL, we can implement this utility-maximizing agent as a function `maxAgent` that takes a state $$s \\in S$$ as input and returns an action. For Tom's choice between restaurants, we assume that the agent starts off in a state `\"initialState\"`, denoting whatever Tom does before going off to eat. The program directly translates the decision rule above using the higher-order function `argMax`.\n<!-- TODO fix argmax -->\n\n~~~~\n///fold: argMax\nvar argMax = function(f, ar){\n  return maxWith(f, ar)[0]\n};\n///\n// Choose to eat at the Italian or French restaurants\nvar actions = ['italian', 'french'];\n\nvar transition = function(state, action) {\n  if (action === 'italian') {\n    return 'pizza';\n  } else {\n    return 'steak frites';\n  }\n};\n\nvar utility = function(state) {\n  if (state === 'pizza') {\n    return 10;\n  } else {\n    return 0;\n  }\n};\n\nvar maxAgent = function(state) {\n  return argMax(\n    function(action) {\n      return utility(transition(state, action));\n    },\n    actions);\n};\n\nprint('Choice in initial state: ' + maxAgent('initialState'));\n~~~~\n\n>**Exercise**: Which parts of the code can you change in order to make the agent choose the French restaurant?\n\nThere is an alternative way to compute the optimal action for this problem. The idea is to treat choosing an action as an *inference* problem. The previous chapter showed how we can *infer* the probability that a coin landed Heads from the observation that two of three coins were Heads. \n\n~~~~\nvar twoHeads = Infer({ \n  model() {\n    var a = flip(0.5);\n    var b = flip(0.5);\n    var c = flip(0.5);\n    condition(a + b + c === 2);\n    return a;\n  }\n});\n\nviz(twoHeads);\n~~~~\n\n\nThe same inference machinery can compute the optimal action in Tom's decision problem. We sample random actions with `uniformDraw` and condition on the preferred outcome happening. Intuitively, we imagine observing the consequence we prefer (e.g. pizza) and then *infer* from this the action that caused this consequence. <!-- address evidential vs causal decision theory? -->\n\nThis idea is known as \"planning as inference\" refp:botvinick2012planning. It also resembles the idea of \"backwards chaining\" in logical inference and planning. The `inferenceAgent` solves the same problem as `maxAgent`, but uses planning as inference: \n\n~~~~\nvar actions = ['italian', 'french'];\n\nvar transition = function(state, action) {\n  if (action === 'italian') {\n    return 'pizza';\n  } else {\n    return 'steak frites';\n  }\n};\n\nvar inferenceAgent = function(state) {\n  return Infer({ \n    model() {\n      var action = uniformDraw(actions);\n      condition(transition(state, action) === 'pizza');\n      return action;\n    }\n  });\n}\n\nviz(inferenceAgent(\"initialState\"));\n~~~~\n\n>**Exercise**: Change the agent's goals so that they choose the French restaurant.\n\n## One-shot decisions in a stochastic world\n\nIn the previous example, the transition function from state-action pairs to states was *deterministic* and so described a deterministic world or environment. Moreover, the agent's actions were deterministic; Tom always chose the best action (\"Italian\"). In contrast, many examples in this tutorial will involve a *stochastic* world and a noisy \"soft-max\" agent. \n\nImagine that Tom is choosing between restaurants again. This time, Tom's preferences are about the overall quality of the meal. A meal can be \"bad\", \"good\" or \"spectacular\" and each restaurant has good nights and bad nights. The transition function now has type signature $$ T\\colon S \\times A \\to \\Delta S $$, where $$\\Delta S$$ represents a distribution over states. Tom's decision rule is now to take the action $$a \\in A$$ that has the highest *average* or *expected* utility, with the expectation $$\\mathbb{E}$$ taken over the probability of different successor states $$s' \\sim T(s,a)$$:\n\n$$\n\\max_{a \\in A} \\mathbb{E}( U(T(s,a)) )\n$$\n\nTo represent this in WebPPL, we extend `maxAgent` using the `expectation` function, which maps a distribution with finite support to its (real-valued) expectation:\n\n~~~~\n///fold: argMax\nvar argMax = function(f, ar){\n  return maxWith(f, ar)[0]\n};\n///\n\nvar actions = ['italian', 'french'];\n\nvar transition = function(state, action) {\n  var nextStates = ['bad', 'good', 'spectacular'];\n  var nextProbs = (action === 'italian') ? [0.2, 0.6, 0.2] : [0.05, 0.9, 0.05];\n  return categorical(nextProbs, nextStates);\n};\n\nvar utility = function(state) {\n  var table = { \n    bad: -10, \n    good: 6, \n    spectacular: 8 \n  };\n  return table[state];\n};\n\nvar maxEUAgent = function(state) {\n  var expectedUtility = function(action) {\n    return expectation(Infer({ \n      model() {\n        return utility(transition(state, action));\n      }\n    }));\n  };\n  return argMax(expectedUtility, actions);\n};\n\nmaxEUAgent('initialState');\n~~~~\n\n>**Exercise**: Adjust the transition probabilities such that the agent chooses the Italian Restaurant.\n\nThe `inferenceAgent`, which uses the planning-as-inference idiom, can also be extended using `expectation`. Previously, the agent's action was conditioned on leading to the best consequence (\"pizza\"). This time, Tom is not aiming to choose the action most likely to have the best outcome. Instead, he wants the action with better outcomes on average. This can be represented in `inferenceAgent` by switching from a `condition` statement to a `factor` statement. The `condition` statement expresses a \"hard\" constraint on actions: actions that fail the condition are completely ruled out. The `factor` statement, by contrast, expresses a \"soft\" condition. Technically, `factor(x)` adds `x` to the unnormalized log-probability of the program execution within which it occurs.\n\nTo illustrate `factor`, consider the following variant of the `twoHeads` example above. Instead of placing a hard constraint on the total number of Heads outcomes, we give each setting of `a`, `b` and `c` a *score* based on the total number of heads. The score is highest when all three coins are Heads, but even the \"all tails\" outcomes is not ruled out completely.\n\n~~~~\nvar softHeads = Infer({ \n  model() {\n    var a = flip(0.5);\n    var b = flip(0.5);\n    var c = flip(0.5);\n    factor(a + b + c);\n    return a;\n  }\n});\n\nviz(softHeads);\n~~~~\n\nAs another example, consider the following short program:\n\n~~~~\nvar dist = Infer({ \n  model() {\n    var n = uniformDraw([0, 1, 2]);\n    factor(n * n);\n    return n;\n  }\n});\n\nviz(dist);\n~~~~\n\nWithout the `factor` statement, each value of the variable `n` has equal probability. Adding the `factor` statements adds `n*n` to the log-score of each value. To get the new probabilities induced by the `factor` statement we compute the normalizing constant given these log-scores. The resulting probability $$P(y=2)$$ is:\n\n$$\nP(y=2) = \\frac {e^{2 \\cdot 2}} { (e^{0 \\cdot 0} + e^{1 \\cdot 1} + e^{2 \\cdot 2}) }\n$$\n\nReturning to our implementation as planning-as-inference for maximizing *expected* utility, we use a `factor` statement to implement soft conditioning:\n\n~~~~\nvar actions = ['italian', 'french'];\n\nvar transition = function(state, action) {\n  var nextStates = ['bad', 'good', 'spectacular'];\n  var nextProbs = (action === 'italian') ? [0.2, 0.6, 0.2] : [0.05, 0.9, 0.05];\n  return categorical(nextProbs, nextStates);\n};\n\nvar utility = function(state) {\n  var table = { \n    bad: -10, \n    good: 6, \n    spectacular: 8 \n  };\n  return table[state];\n};\n\nvar alpha = 1;\n\nvar softMaxAgent = function(state) {\n  return Infer({ \n    model() {\n\n      var action = uniformDraw(actions);\n\n      var expectedUtility = function(action) {\n        return expectation(Infer({ \n          model() {\n            return utility(transition(state, action));\n          }\n        }));\n      };\n      \n      factor(alpha * expectedUtility(action));\n      \n      return action;\n    }\n  });\n};\n\nviz(softMaxAgent('initialState'));\n~~~~\n\nThe `softMaxAgent` differs in two ways from the `maxEUAgent` above. First, it uses the planning-as-inference idiom. Second, it does not deterministically choose the action with maximal expected utility. Instead, it implements *soft* maximization, selecting actions with a probability that depends on their expected utility. Formally, let the agent's probability of choosing an action be $$C(a;s)$$ for $$a \\in A$$ when in state $$s \\in S$$. Then the *softmax* decision rule is:\n\n$$\nC(a; s) \\propto e^{\\alpha \\mathbb{E}(U(T(s,a))) }\n$$\n\nThe noise parameter $$\\alpha$$ modulates between random choice $$(\\alpha=0)$$ and the perfect maximization $$(\\alpha = \\infty)$$ of the `maxEUAgent`.\n\nSince rational agents will *always* choose the best action, why consider softmax agents? One of the goals of this tutorial is to infer the preferences of agents (e.g. human beings) from their choices. People do not always choose the normatively rational actions. The softmax agent provides a simple, analytically tractable model of sub-optimal choice[^softmax], which has been tested empirically on human action selection refp:luce2005individual. Moreover, it has been used extensively in Inverse Reinforcement Learning as a model of human errors refp:kim2014inverse, refp:zheng2014robust. For this reason, we employ the softmax model throughout this tutorial. When modeling an agent assumed to be optimal, the noise parameter $$\\alpha$$ can be set to a large value. <!-- [TODO: Alternatively, agent could output dist.MAP().val instead of dist.] -->\n\n[^softmax]: A softmax agent's choice of action is a differentiable function of their utilities. This differentiability makes possible certain techniques for inferring utilities from choices.\n\n>**Exercise**: Monty Hall. In this exercise inspired by [ProbMods](https://probmods.org/chapters/06-inference-about-inference.html), we will approach the classical statistical puzzle from the perspective of optimal decision-making. Here is a statement of the problem:\n\n> *Alice is on a game show and she’s given the choice of three doors. Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. She picks door 1. The host, Monty, knows what’s behind the doors and opens another door, say No. 3, revealing a goat. He then asks Alice if she wants to switch doors. Should she switch?*\n\n> Use the tools introduced above to determine the answer. Here is some code to get you started:\n\n~~~~\n// Remove each element in array ys from array xs\nvar remove = function(xs, ys) {\n  return _.without.apply(null, [xs].concat(ys));\n};\n\nvar doors = [1, 2, 3];\n\n// Monty chooses a door that is neither Alice's door\n// nor the prize door\nvar monty = function(aliceDoor, prizeDoor) {\n  return Infer({ \n    model() {\n      var door = uniformDraw(doors);\n      // ???\n      return door;\n    }});\n};\n\n\nvar actions = ['switch', 'stay'];\n\n// If Alice switches, she randomly chooses a door that is\n// neither the one Monty showed nor her previous door\nvar transition = function(state, action) {\n  if (action === 'switch') {\n    return {\n      prizeDoor: state.prizeDoor,\n      montyDoor: state.montyDoor,\n      aliceDoor: // ???\n    };\n  } else {\n    return state;\n  }\n};\n\n// Utility is high (say 10) if Alice's door matches the\n// prize door, 0 otherwise.\nvar utility = function(state) {\n  // ???\n};\n\nvar sampleState = function() {\n  var aliceDoor = uniformDraw(doors);\n  var prizeDoor = uniformDraw(doors);\n  return {\n    aliceDoor,\n    prizeDoor,\n    montyDoor: sample(monty(aliceDoor, prizeDoor))\n  }\n}\n\nvar agent = function() {  \n  var action = uniformDraw(actions);\n  var expectedUtility = function(action){    \n    return expectation(Infer({ \n      model() {\n        var state = sampleState();\n        return utility(transition(state, action));\n      }}));\n  };\n  factor(expectedUtility(action));\n  return { action };\n};\n\nviz(Infer({ model: agent }));\n~~~~\n\n### Moving to complex decision problems\n\nThis chapter has introduced some of the core concepts that we will need for this tutorial, including *expected utility*, *(stochastic) transition functions*, *soft conditioning* and *softmax decision making*. These concepts would also appear in standard treatments of rational planning and reinforcement learning refp:russell1995modern. The actual decision problems in this chapter are so trivial that our notation and programs are overkill.\n\nThe [next chapter](/chapters/3a-mdp.html) introduces *sequential* decisions problems. These problems are more complex and interesting, and will require the machinery we have introduced here. \n\n<br>\n\n### Footnotes\n",
